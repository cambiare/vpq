VPQ: Variable Persistence Queue

The problem this is intending to solve is an asynchronous queue that has a 
maximum size greater than the amount of heap/memory limitation of the queued
objects.  

An example use case is a request logger that delivers requests data
to an external system, such as a database or external queue.  Under normal 
circumstances, the queue will exist in memory as messages are processed out to
the dependent system quickly.  If the dependent external system is unavailable, 
a normal asynchronous queue would grow until all memory is consumed or messages 
are thrown out.  With this, messages will continue to be queued into file based 
persistence which will be drained when the dependent system becomes available 
again.

The idea is that a request logger allows the request to continue quickly with 
asynchronous logging, but avoids failures when the dependent system is 
unavailable.
